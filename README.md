score4
======

This a score-4 (connect four) game with 2 modes with Graphical User Interface. 
- Human vs Human
- Human vs Computer (based on MiniMax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning)

This is not a sophisticated approach in terms of heuristics, i just wanted to make something functional within a couple of days, just for practice and fun!

Note: Hard mode is laggy because of single-threaded approach. Maybe i'll fix it by using multiple threads in the future!
